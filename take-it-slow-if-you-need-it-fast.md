As a programmer in this small shop, I’m constantly reminded of what happens when I try to go faster by ignoring broken windows. It doesn’t work! You can postpone that refactoring or those tests or this automation for only so long before it starts to hurt both motivationally and economically. But its exactly at that point, when the hurt is pressing, that its the hardest to step back.

In the moment of pressure, it’s incredibly easy to commit the fallacy of thinking that you “don’t have time to do the right thing”. That’s a big warning sign and should condition your brain to slap you when the thought pops into your head.

The reason, of course, is that no business and no project lives or dies by what you do today, but rather as the result of your actions over a longer stretch. This goes for any activity, not just programming. Are you answering the same question over and over again in customer support? Inline the answer at the point of trouble. Or otherwise adjust to be self-explanatory.

Realize that “don’t have time right now” is a self-fulling prophesy. You will never have time right now if you don’t take it today. The business is not going to slow down to allow you to clean all these things up one wonderful day. It just won’t happen.

In other words, you want to take it slow if you need it fast.
