  > Traditional approaches assumed that if we just tried hard enough, we could anticipate the complete set of requirements early and reduce cost by eliminating change. Today, eliminating change early means being unresponsive to business conditions—in other words, business failure.
  
- [Agile Software Development: The People Factor](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9558/7f603098b5b30253b727cb9e0ddaac6ba164.pdf)

  > The first is the idea that the business and technology worlds have become turbulent, high speed, and uncertain, requiring
a process to both create change and respond rapidly to change. 

  > The first connotation implies the second one: An agile process requires responsive people and organizations.
Agile development focuses on the talents and skills of individuals and molds process to specific people and teams, not the other way around.

- [Why slow thinking wins](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2015/07/25/the-power-slow-thinking/ToZbzYl7rG0yVMCtsZ7WnJ/story.html)

  > Everyone remembers the story of the tortoise and the hare, but no one seems to have learned the lesson it teaches: Slowness wins.

- [Technical debt 101](https://medium.com/@joaomilho/festina-lente-e29070811b84)

  > A “debt” means that you traded acquiring something now for a long-term financial burden. This burden is not just about repaying what you got: there is an “interest”. It means that, even if you pay your debt timely, you’ll pay more than you took, and if you don’t, your debt will keep increasing even if you don’t do anything. And if you ignore a debt long enough, it will become unpayable and you’ll get “bankrupt”.

  > The problem of big rewrites is that they are a technical solution to a cultural problem.

  > He thought nothing less becoming in a well-trained leader than haste and rashness, and, accordingly, favorite sayings of his were: More haste, less speed.

  > That is done quickly enough which is done well enough.

- [Defining and Dealing with Technical Debt](https://css-tricks.com/defining-and-dealing-with-technical-debt/)

  > The one thing worth taking away from the Wikipedia entry is that not all technical debt is created equal. In fact, there are four types of debt to consider. Let's take a look at each one.

- [Getting Real: Take it slow if you need it fast](https://signalvnoise.com/archives2/getting_real_take_it_slow_if_you_need_it_fast.php)

  > In the moment of pressure, it’s incredibly easy to commit the fallacy of thinking that you “don’t have time to do the right thing”. That’s a big warning sign and should condition your brain to slap you when the thought pops into your head.

- [Bad code isn't Technical Debt, it's an unhedged Call Option](http://higherorderlogic.com/2010/07/bad-code-isnt-technical-debt-its-an-unhedged-call-option/)

  > This is all Chris Matts‘ idea. He realised that the problem with the “Technical Debt” metaphor is that for managers debt can be a good thing. Executives can be required to take on more debt because it makes the finances work better, it might even be encouraged by tax breaks. This is not the same debt as your personal credit card. Chris came up with a better metaphor, the Call Option.

- [Code Review Checklist](https://ana-balica.github.io/2017/02/21/code-review-checklist/)

  > Over the last couple of months, I’ve developed my own internal code review checklist. I use it both for reviewing for own finished code and my teammates code complete tickets. It’s split up into 3 sections: code, automated testing and manual testing.
  
- [Solve it once](http://gedd.ski/post/solve-it-once/)

  > When you set out to solve a problem, the biggest temptation is to do a quick fix. [..] Here’s a better way to work: if it happens twice, solve it once. Like, actually solve it.
